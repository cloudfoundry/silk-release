    description: "Log Level for silk-daemon to start with"
    default: info

  logging.format.timestamp:
    description: |
        Format for timestamp in the drain log. Valid values are 'rfc3339' and 'deprecated'.
        This property only affects the drain log because other component and bosh lifecycle logs were already in the rfc3339 format.
        'rfc3339' is the recommended format. It will result in all timestamps in the drain log controlled by silk-daemon to be in RFC3339 format, which is human readable. This does not include stderr logs from golang libraries.
        'deprecated' will result in all timestamps being in the format they were before the rfc3339 flag was introduced for the drain log.  We do not recommend using this flag unless you have scripts that expect a particular timestamp format.
    default: "rfc3339"

  healthchecker.failure_counter_file:
    description: "File used by the healthchecker to monitor consecutive failures."
    default: /var/vcap/data/silk-daemon/counters/consecutive_healthchecker_failures.count
