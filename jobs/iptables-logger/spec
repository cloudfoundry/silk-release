  logging.format.timestamp:
    description: |
      Format for timestamp in component logs. Valid values are 'rfc3339', 'deprecated'.
      'rfc3339' is the recommended format. It will result in all timestamps controlled by iptables-logger to be in RFC3339 format, which is human readable.
      'deprecated' will result in all timestamps being in the format they were before the rfc3339 flag was introduced. This format is different for different logs. We do not recommend using this flag unless you have scripts that expect a particular timestamp format.
    default: "rfc3339"
